# Currency Converter with Login

So basically, this repository hosts the documentation, and code for the currency converter which I have made, with the assistance of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

There is an additional version of this project which is more advanced, which will replace this current version if I decide to finish it up. Though this is just the base and it works, mainly so I can pass as it covers all requirements.

# Default Login

The program has one login as of current, which is the following
  - Username: default
  - Password: password

# Customizability

Honestly, it is really simple to customize the program, so I won't have support for this. And in the program, it is documented what everything does.
